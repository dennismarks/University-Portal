## PORTAL - Course Search Made Easy

Portal is a website that compiles every piece of information about a course. From course descriptions to syllabi and professors to forum/reddit conversations about them. We will utilize and gather information from go-to sites that students often refer to when they start their research, such as the course calendar, Reddit, and course websites, and syndicate this information in a way that is digestible and easy to access.

## Getting Started

To run the application, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Build

To build a production release, run:

```
npm run build
```

The output of the build process will be located in the `build/` folder.

## Motivation

Students at UofT today have to do a lot of research themselves on multiple sites and sources to really understand what a course is about before enrolment. Often the course info provided by the departments are insufficient or, at times, misrepresents what the course is really about. There is no central portal to aid with course selection!

As students ourselves, we believe that a site like Portal would massively change the game of choosing courses. Through our website, students will be **more informed** about their course selection and make sure that their **time and money are spent well** during their post-secondary journey.
